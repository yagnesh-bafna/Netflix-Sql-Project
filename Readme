📊 This project dives into the **Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset** to uncover insights about Netflix’s content library. Using SQL, I explored trends based on **ratings, year of release, countries, durations, genres, and more**.

What is this project?

This is a hands-on SQL project, where I practiced solving real business problems using the Netflix dataset.
It’s not just about queries — it’s about **thinking like a data analyst** and extracting meaningful insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Understand Netflix’s catalog distribution (Movies vs TV Shows).
2. Identify content patterns (ratings, countries, genres, durations).
3. Track historical trends (releases over the years, recent 5 years).
4. Highlight key people (directors, actors) shaping Netflix’s content.
5. Classify sensitive content (using keywords like *kill* and *violence*).
